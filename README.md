Some algorithms that were interesting to me and I decided to add them to this repository

## Hamming Code Parser

This is the simple Hamming Code parser which can encrypt any value to the Hamming Code. I've written this program to check if I really understand this topic. You can use it whatever you like.

### Usage
$ python3 hamming_code.py <value_to_parse>

# Algorithms
Some algorithms that were interesting to me and I decided to add them to this repository

## Hamming Code Parser

This is the simple Hamming Code parser which can encrypt any value to the Hamming Code. I've written this program to check if I really understand this topic. You can use it whatever you like.

### Usage
$ python3 hamming_code.py <value_to_parse>

## Quick Sort

Quick Sort algorithm is known to everyone, but this one is written using the pointers. I know that working with the pointers isn't a good practice when we have to think about security of the program, but I decided to use the pointers to learn about them. In addition it is a good example to look because I am going to create Quick Sort algorithm is Assembly. :)

This algorithm sorts an array in the range <-1, 100). (obviously this numbers are random) You can type the size of an array to sort.
 
### Usage
$ gcc q_sort.c -o q_sort
$ ./q_sort
